## See the Demo :point_right: <a href="https://vinyl-record-maker.web.app/">Here</a> 

### An online interactive music visualization. You can:
#### :musical_keyboard:   Play notes from 5 music octaves 
#### :art: :notes:   See and hear how your record is made by the melody you played. 
#### :wind_chime:   Get a suprise from the chords that best fit your melody. You can hear how the chords sound and what notes they are from the visualization.

##### Hope you can feel the warmth from the melody visualization when you play along :blush:
